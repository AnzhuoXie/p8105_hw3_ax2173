## Problem 1


## Problem 2

Import, clean and manipulate data.

```{r}
acc_df = 
  read_csv("./Data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_or_weekend = ifelse((day == 'Saturday' | day == "Sunday"), 'Weekend', 'Weekday')
    ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1 : activity_1440,
    names_to = 'activity_num',
    values_to = 'activity_counts'
  ) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, weekday_or_weekend, everything())
```

* There are some descriptions:
  * This dataset contains these variables: `r colnames(acc_df)`
  * There are totally `r nrow(acc_df)` observations
  * There are totally `r ncol(acc_df)` variables

Aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table to show these totals.

```{r}
acc_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day_id, day) %>% 
  summarize(day_activity = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

Let's make a point plot to see whether there are any trends apparent. 

* I am not sure, but I guess the day activity is relatively lower in weekends than in weekdays.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
acc_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day_id, day) %>% 
  summarize(day_activity = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_id, y = day_activity)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = 'The daily activity of this 63-year-old man',
    x = 'the day ID',
    y = 'the day activity',
    caption = 'the day activity is aggregated across minutes'
  )
```
