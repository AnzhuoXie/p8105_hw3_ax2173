## Problem 1


## Problem 2

Import, clean and manipulate data.

```{r}
acc_df = 
  read_csv("./Data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_or_weekend = ifelse((day == 'Saturday' | day == "Sunday"), 'Weekend', 'Weekday')
    ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1 : activity_1440,
    names_to = 'activity_num',
    values_to = 'activity_counts'
  ) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, weekday_or_weekend, everything())
```

* There are some descriptions:
  * This dataset contains these variables: `r colnames(acc_df)`
  * There are totally `r nrow(acc_df)` observations
  * There are totally `r ncol(acc_df)` variables

Aggregate across minutes to create a total activity variable for each day.

```{r}

```
